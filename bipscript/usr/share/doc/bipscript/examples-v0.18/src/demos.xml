  <demo name="Robot Jazz Band">
The [robot jazz band](robotjazz/robotjazz.html) is an interactive backing band
for a human performer. The band consists of three bots:

* [comp piano](robotjazz/comppiano.html) - plays comping chords on the piano
* [swing drum](robotjazz/swingdrum.html) - plays a simple swing beat on the drums
* [walking bass](robotjazz/walkingbass.html) - plays a simple walking bass line

All three take a parameter called "power" which controls playing louder and busier vs softer and sparser.

The [main script](robotjazz/robotjazz.html) adds one of each bot to an audio mixer,
and controls the power level via three different sources:

* MIDI control change messages from e.g. a control surface
* Audio onset detection, e.g. on an audio stream of the human performer
* OSC messages from any software or hardware source
